# DNS exfiltration

This repo demonstrates the performance of various types of classifiers from
the scikit-learn and xbgoost Python libraries, applied to the problem of
detecting exfiltration in DNS requests. The datasets used are available
[here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/c4n7fckkz3).

For usage examples, please see the `model_comparison.ipynb` notebook. 

For details on working with the datasets, please consult the docstrings
in `exfiltration_dataset.py` and `exfiltration_classifier.py`.
